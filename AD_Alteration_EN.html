<h3>How to make alteration or revocation of an advance directive?</h3>
<p>Even if the patient has already made an advance directive, he/she may, as long as remaining mentally competent, alter or revoke the advance directive he/she made at any time. Once the patient has made a new, valid advance directive, the new one will replace the old one. The patient should keep his/her healthcare professionals and family informed of any amendment or revocation.</p>
<ol>
<li>For clarity and avoidance of doubt, revocations of advance directives should be made in writing and follow the model form proposed by the Government (click <a href="https://www.s100.hk/en/topics/Health-and-care/Advance-directives/Alteration-or-revocation-of-an-advance-directive/revocation%20of%20advance%20directive%20form.pdf">here</a> to download the Government&rsquo;s proposed revocation form).</li>
<li>If the revocation is made in writing, it should be made in the presence of a person aged 18 or above and who has no interest in your estate.</li>
<li>If the revocation is made verbally, it should be made in the presence of a doctor, a lawyer or other independent person, aged 18 or above, who has no interest in the patient&rsquo;s estate. If practical, the witness should document the verbal advance directive using the model form proposed by the Government (click <a href="https://www.s100.hk/en/topics/Health-and-care/Advance-directives/Alteration-or-revocation-of-an-advance-directive/record%20of%20oral%20revocation%20of%20advance%20directive%20form.pdf">here</a> to download the form).</li>
<li>Once the original advance directive is revoked, a new directive may be made according to the aforementioned procedures.</li>
