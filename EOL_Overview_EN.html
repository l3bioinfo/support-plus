<p><strong>Life - going full circle </strong></p>
<p>Life is like a marathon. Once we step past the starting line, we can only continue to charge forward with no turning back. Most people start off with tears, accompanied by countless expectations and cheers from their relatives, then by countless ups and downs - shedding a lot of blood, sweat and tears in the process. Some may say, when one reaches the finish line, it is almost like an award ceremony of life - the time to receive a gold medal. If certain matters could be planned before crossing the line, which include making a will, funeral arrangement, pre-setting care plans, and expressing our wishes to our family in advance, regrets and unnecessary disputes will definitely be reduced. This award ceremony can also be completed according to our own wishes, and the marathon of life will be more complete.</p>
<p><strong>The Will</strong></p>
<p>The will is a legal document with binding powers. The function of a will is to allow the testator (who writes the will) to distribute their estate according to their wishes. Since this is a legal document, legal advice should be consulted when making a will to ensure its validity. If the deceased did not make a will during their lifetime, their estate will be handled in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Funerary arrangements</strong></p>
<p>In Hong Kong, there are different options to choose from: cremation, burial, and green burials that have emerged in recent years, including the scattering of ashes of the deceased either in memorial gardens or at sea. Having "a peaceful end at old age" is the wish of many in Hong Kong society. If funeral arrangements are planned in advance, family members can handle the funeral according to the wishes of their loved one. They will also feel relieved to be able to handle such arrangements according to the wishes of the deceased, which may also slightly alleviate the immense pain of losing a loved one.</p>
<p><strong>Organ and body donation</strong></p>
<p>When life comes to an end and your body no longer functions, you may want to do a noble deed by donating organs to patients in need, or your remains to universities for teaching purposes. Should you be interested in this, remember to register in advance and inform your family of your wishes.</p>
<p><strong>Advance Care Plan (ACP)</strong></p>
<p>The ACP is planned for when a patient is still mentally able to make their own informed decisions for end-of-life care. Through discussion with their family members and healthcare team, he or she plans the medical treatment and nursing conditions he or she hopes to receive at the end of his or her life. In this way, even if patients lose the ability to communicate at the end of their lives, they can still receive excellent care tailored to nearly each and every one of their personal wishes.</p>
<p><strong>Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA)</strong></p>
<p>The EPA is a legal document that allows an authorizer (that is, one who intends to grant their power to others) to appoint an executor when they are mentally sound, so that when the authorizer becomes incapacitated in the future, the authorized person can take care of his financial affairs. The general power of attorney will lose its validity when the authorizer becomes incapacitated, but the permanent power of attorney will be continuously valid after the authorizer loses mental capacity, and it will be given power to the executor to continue to handle the authorizer&rsquo;s financial affairs.</p>
