<p><strong>Grief </strong></p>
<p>When you lose something or someone that is valuable or important to you, you may experience a period of grief. People who live with cancer may grieve for many reasons, such as the inability to take care a child, the loss of control of the health, the loss of a body part. Grieving can be a long and painful process after the death of someone we love. Everyone&rsquo;s experience of grief is unique. We go through this process in our own way and in our own time.</p>
<p>The nature, intensity and duration we grieve may be influenced by the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The age, gender, personality and the coping style of the grieving person.</li>
<li>The relationship with the person who died.</li>
<li>The cause of death.</li>
<li>The support systems of the grieving person, including the family, friends, social communities and religious or spiritual beliefs.</li>
<li>How the life of the grieving person will change after the loved died.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the stages of grief? </strong></p>
<p>In general, there are 5 stages of grief.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Denial </strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You may feel shocked or numb when you hear about the death of someone. You may feel that something is unfinished and unsaid.</li>
<li>Denial is a normal reaction to great loss. This is a temporary way to deal with the rush of overwhelming emotion.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Anger </strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>After the shock and numb, you need to face the reality. You may feel frustrated and hopeless. These feelings may turn to anger towards other people, yourself or even your God.</li>
<li>You may feel relieved after the death of someone whom you have been taking care for a long time. However, at the same time, you may feel guilty for having that sense of relief.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Bargaining</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Bargaining is the thought that you want to change the circumstances (loss of the loved ones) with another situation. Common thoughts are &ldquo;If only&hellip;&rdquo; and &ldquo;What if&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>You may wish to undo something that has already occurred. For example, &ldquo;I would go for lunch every week with my grandma if only I could have her back&rdquo;, or &ldquo;If my wife was here, I would tell her how much I loved her&rdquo;.</li>
<li>You may also ask for a higher power or God. By asking a higher power to bring someone back, you are acknowledging your loved one is gone.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Depression</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Depression after a loss is not the same as clinical depression. Feeling sad is a normal reaction.</li>
<li>You may feel depressed, intense sadness, loneliness, low energy, change of sleep pattern, loss of appetite, lack of interest in daily activities, withdrawal from social life and fear about future.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Acceptance</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In this final stage of grief, you accept the reality of your loss. This may take months to years.</li>
<li>The intensity of grief lessens with time although the sadness may come again especially on the special days (birthdays, anniversary, holidays) or places or things that arouse your memory of the loved one. You will return to life gradually. Readjustment of life brings hope and a desire to dream.</li>
<li>People accept the loss and try to start a new page of life. Life is more joyful. Good days are gradually increasing.</li>
<li>You may also find ways to get connected with the person you lost. For example, thinking about his/her advice given you, looking at the photos and watching the videos, reading the letters sent from him/her, reading the online page to share memories, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the common misconceptions about grief? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grief means sadness.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Grief is not just sadness. It can affect every part of your life&mdash;emotions, behavior, beliefs, relationships and physical wellbeing. People with grief usually have both emotional and physical manifestations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The stages of grief are in order.</strong>
<ul>
<li>People may encounter different emotions during grieving and these emotions may not appear in particular order. The process of grieving just likes a roller coaster, full of ups and downs, with unpredictable feelings and behaviors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The timing of each stage of grief is similar for every people.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Different people go through the stages of grief differently. Some may have quick recovery while some need more time. This process is unique to every grieved person. It is important to respect individual ways of grieving.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>After the last stage of acceptance, grief is over.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Waves of grief may come and go over months or years. Even years after the loss, you may feel sad sometimes when you think of him/her.</li>
<li>Although the grief may never completely go away, you find a way of forward with support and understanding.</li>
