<p><strong><em><u>Dying at home with dignity: an overview</u></em></strong></p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s one big party, they say. Where everyone wants to stay and have as much fun as they want forever. But there comes a moment where we must leave at some point during it. Nobody knows exactly when it will be their turn to go. However, everyone can use their time to prepare beforehand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people think of leaving this world as lying on a cold hard cot, all alone in a hospital ward. It is normal to think of it this way, as most see the hospital as the last place to go before dying. Statistically speaking, over 90 percent of patients pass away like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, on the other side, imagine leaving this world in the comfort of your own home. A familiar and safe place with soft music playing over the radio, the sun shining gently through the windows and better yet -- being surrounded by family and friends for one last send-off.</p>
<p>In fact, this very concept is becoming increasingly popular in Hong Kong. Social enterprises such as St. James Settlement and Forget Thee Not have launched consulting services and support plans for patients with terminal illnesses, affording them and their families ample time to prepare for when it is finally time to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><u>What are the essential components to prepare before the decision of &ldquo;dying-at-home"?</u></em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em><u>For the patient: What are my last wishes?</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>What are my thoughts of this whole &ldquo;Die-at-Home" plan?</li>
<li>Is it better than leaving this world in a hospital?</li>
<li>What ideas do my carer(s) and family have about this?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><em><u>For carer and family: Aspects worth considering</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>What are my own wishes? Are they similar to my loved one/person under my care?</li>
<li>Assuming I really want to go down this route: am I physically able to do it though?</li>
<li>How well equipped is the home to support this decision?</li>
<li>Do I have any family members willing to care for the patient full-time?</li>
</ul>
<p>If all these points can be answered, the doctor in charge of the patient&rsquo;s care would benefit greatly if they were informed of this. Tell them about this whenever you feel like it, for example during the next appointment.</p>
<p>Caring for a patient with a severe or even terminal illness is no easy task. As your loved one nears the end of life, mobility and day-to-day activities will have to be taken care of by at least 2 family members in charge of full-time care. Discussion and agreement between both patient and caregiver will of course be top priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><em><u>Prepare the home environment</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>With the space there is now, is the home capable of supporting the patient&rsquo;s wish of passing away at home?</li>
<li>Is there enough space for medical equipment to be placed near or around the patient?</li>
</ul>
<p>The second question point is especially important when the patient enters their last stage of life. Equipment such as an electrocardiogram to measure heart rate and an oxygen generation machine will have to be able to fit in the room or space where the patient is resting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong><em><u>Informing health professionals about the last wish</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Health professionals such as your oncologist, GP and nurses should have full knowledge of both the patient&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s wishes as part of the patient&rsquo;s support network.</li>
<li>Discussions should be tailored towards how your loved one wants to be cared for if the situation changes down the line.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*If it was decided to follow the pass-at-home route, once the heart stops beating, insufficient time to start life-saving procedures such as CPR will result in death. However, health professionals will treat the wishes of you and your loved ones with utmost respect. * </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong><em><u>Signing the Advance Directive</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The Advance Directive is a set of medical instructions for your medical team that is legally binding. It is a physical document that must be kept safely after signing.</li>
<li>You have to be at least 18 years old to sign this Advance Directive. The only other thing required is that you are conscious and of sound mind.</li>
<li>Besides your signature, two guarantors which do not benefit from your will are required to give theirs too. One of the guarantors must be a Hong Kong-registered doctor.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong><em><u>Arranging at-home consultation</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Finding a private-practice doctor is one of the steps needed in this process. The doctor will perform what you would expect of a normal health check-up, but at your home.</li>
<li>A typical checkup will be performed at least once every 2 weeks, or at a frequency that both you and your doctor agree to.</li>
<li>The doctor should also be willing to sign a Certificate of Death for the patient. Hong Kong law states that signing this is only for the visiting doctor responsible or another one who performed a checkup at least 2 weeks before the passing of the patient.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong><em><u>At the very end:</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When the patient enters the last moments before passing away, family members need to contact their designated private-practice doctor as soon as possible. The doctor will come and assess the patient. He/she will assess and certify the death of the patient, e.g. using ECG to certify there is no more heartbeat. After certifying death, the doctor will sign the "Medical Certificate" as required by law.</li>
<li>Family members then need to notify mortuary staff to arrange transportation of the deceased&rsquo;s body from the home to a funeral parlour. Family members are also required to bring the medical certificate and patient&rsquo;s ID card to register death at the Death Registry within 24 hours after death.</li>
</ul>
